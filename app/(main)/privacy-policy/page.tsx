          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Obtaining Your Consent</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We will always seek your consent before collecting or using your personal information. While sharing
            personal data is optional, please note that certain information is necessary for processing orders. As a
            result, completing transactions may not be possible without your consent.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Verifying and Ensuring Accuracy of Data</h3>

            The information we collect is strictly for business purposes. We may request you to confirm the accuracy of
