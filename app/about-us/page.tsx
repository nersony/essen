              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Founded in 2020, Essen was born from a passion for beautiful, functional living spaces. Our founders,
                having experienced the challenges of furnishing their own homes in Singapore, recognized a gap in the
                market for high-quality, stylish furniture that doesn't compromise on affordability.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                The name "Essen" derives from the word "essential," reflecting our philosophy that furniture should be
                both necessary and meaningful. We believe that a well-designed home enhances daily life, creating spaces
                where memories are made and cherished.
